# Quiz10


As discussed in class, our second project will be due on Wednesday May 11th. 

- The project will require a written report and a short verbal presentation.
- Groups of up to size 3 will be permitted.
- The project should include a blocking factor and at least 2 different treatment factors.

Project 2 will have three different components: An exerimental design plan

#### Experimental Design Plan (10 points)

The experimental design should address the following 10 items

1. Define objectives
2. Define meaningful and measurable response
3. Diagram treatment application process for a single run
4. Identify experimental units
5. List sources of variation
6. Perform pilot runs
7. Choose experimental design (i.e. randomization)
8. Determine number of replicates required
9. Describe method(s) for data analysis
10. Timetable and budget for resources to complete experiment

Bullet points and short answer are acceptable. This should help inform your written project summary.


#### Written Project Summary (40 points)

The written project summary should contain complete sentences and paragraphs. Please follow the suggested structure for the project summary.

1. __Introduction__: define research object and state why it is important, interesting, or useful
2. __Experimental Units and Randomization:__ items 2 - 5 + 7. Describe experimental units and how responses will be measured. Discuss additional sources of variation and how they were controlled for or, alternatively, how they may impact results. Finally, detail the treatment assignment procedure. You are welcome to embed code.
3. __Pilot Study and Sample Size Calculations:__ Summarize what you learned from your pilot study. Include sample size calculations - specify and defend your assumptions and choices. Again - it is okay if you cannot achieve the desired sample 
4. __Data Overview:__ Describe your data and present figure(s) to illustrate the response.
5. __Data Analysis and Results:__ Describe your statistical methods and interpret your results.
6 __Discussion:__ Provide a written discussion about the take-away points from your study. (You can skip the statistical jargon in this section). Also feel free to include commentary about any lessons you learned through this process.
- General writing: grammar, spelling, sentence and paragraph structure

#### Verbal Project Summary (25 points)
Depending on the total number of groups, I'd anticipate 4 - 5 minutes for each group. Presentations should _briefly_ cover the following:

1. __Introduction__: define research object and state why it is important, interesting, or useful
2. __Experimental Units and Randomization:__ Describe experimental units and how responses will be measured. Detail the treatment assignment procedure.
3. __Sample Size Calculations:__ Sample size calculations - specify and defend your assumptions and choices. 
4. __Data Overview:__ Describe your data and present figure(s) to illustrate the response.
5. __Data Analysis and Discussion:__ Interpret your results and include take-away points from the study.


## Questions:

Complete items 1 - 6 in your experimental design checklist and provide evidence that you have completed a pilot study.
